Angular 5 Hello world

This sample app allows you to begin learning Angular without installing anything. Just open index.html in a local web server (for example click the Chrome icon in IDEA with index.html open.)

Note, that running Angular this way is very slow, you should use Angular-cli for deploying a real app.
